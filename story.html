					<p class="text">A little over two years ago, Alex and Reagan reconnected in the ultimate millennial fashion: through Facebook. Growing up in Sacramento, Alex and Reagan knew of each other, but only through mutual friends. In April 2015, Reagan messaged Alex about changing his Instagram name, and Alex pulled the ‘I don’t use Facebook that much, here’s my number so you can text me’ line; starting a conversation that will last a lifetime.</p>

					<p class="text">After a month of talking, texting and dating, Alex and Reagan made it official when they hiked to Castle Rock in Santa Clara. Over the next year, they attended concerts, got to know one another’s friends and families and most importantly, fell in love.</p>

					<p class="text">Nine months later, Reagan moved to the Bay Area, and they signed their first apartment together, in the slow, sleepy town of Fremont. They survived furniture shopping, Ikea, decorating and the entire moving process, all while Alex was completing his computer engineering degree at Santa Clara. When Alex graduated in June of 2016, the training wheels came off, and they began living together full time, working out, cooking and loving each other every step of the way.</p>

					<p class="text">On the cold day of December 16, 2016, Alex took Reagan on a winter wonderland date to San Jose’s Christmas in the Park, to admire the decor, the ‘snow’ and the beautiful Christmas trees. While walking along the path, Alex got down on one knee and asked Reagan to marry him, giving her the biggest surprise of her life. Through her happy tears, she said yes, and the rest is history.</p>
